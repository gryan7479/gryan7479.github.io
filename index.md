=========================

  Hello, my name is Ryan Gallardo and I am a first year student at California State University of Fullerton and I am majoring in Electrical Engineering and planning on graduating in the year 2029 or 2030.

My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
--------------------------

* Lab 5, part 2
    This was an interesting lab because I was able to use if statements and else if statements which became so easy to use. This became one of my favorites due to converting integers into doubles when converting feet into inches.

* Lab 6 part 1
    This one was probably my most favorite one just because we can make our own sandwich, within reason, and it would print out the bread, the meat, and the condiment we would input. It also helped me learn about how to use vectors and having a vector and determine its size

* Lab 9 part 1
    This activity with the secret number game was also a very interactive and fun activity. Although it was a simple game it had a lot of impact on me by helping me understand more about if statements and how examples in the lecture can come to the lab and create a full connection
